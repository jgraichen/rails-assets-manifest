[![Gem Version](https://img.shields.io/gem/v/rails-assets-manifest?logo=ruby)](https://rubygems.org/gems/rails-assets-manifest)
[![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/jgraichen/rails-assets-manifest/test.yml?logo=github)](https://github.com/jgraichen/rails-assets-manifest/actions)

Load all assets in your Rails application from a `manifest.json`, e.g. generated by [webpack-assets-manifest](https://github.com/webdeveric/webpack-assets-manifest).

This gem does not make any assumption on which tool to use to make your assets not how to configure or invoke it. It only requires a manifest JSON. The manifest must either be a simple string map or must map to objects having a `'src'` attribute. Sub-resource integrity is supported too:

```json
{
  "application.css": {
    "src": "2b16adf6f756625a0194.css",
    "integrity": "sha384-/oreyvcV6U6htGZD0fDWR8/Txezke8KhD0QNgHb660hSaW7M+ZzxxuB4Vo+PuAC9"
  },
  "application.js": {
    "src": "2b16adf6f756625a0194.js",
    "integrity": "sha384-iJ55fQQApbQGxWEWSbWStBabi+yNGxZSQy/010+1Dhxl+rymyhGF4NtjUkOsYv7B"
  }
}
```

This gem does not add new helper methods but extends the existing helpers. SRI is automatically added if available and within a secure context. A `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute is automatically added if non is present.

```slim
html
  head
    = stylesheet_link_tag 'application', media: 'all'
    = javascript_include_tag 'application'
```

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="2b16adf6f756625a0194.css" integrity="sha384-/oreyvcV6U6htGZD0fDWR8/Txezke8KhD0QNgHb660hSaW7M+ZzxxuB4Vo+PuAC9" crossorigin="anonymous">
<script src="2b16adf6f756625a0194.js" integrity="sha384-iJ55fQQApbQGxWEWSbWStBabi+yNGxZSQy/010+1Dhxl+rymyhGF4NtjUkOsYv7B" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rails-assets-manifest'
```

## Usage

The manifest path can be configured e.g. in an `environments/*.rb` file:

```ruby
  config.assets_manifest.path = "public/.asset-manifest.json"
```

If `config.cache_classes` is set to `true` the manifest file be loaded once on boot. Assets included with `integrity: true` will raise an error if the integrity option is missing in the manifest.

## Webpack Assets Manifest Example

The following snippet provides an example configuration for the[webpack-assets-manifest](https://github.com/webdeveric/webpack-assets-manifest) plugin to generating a compatible assets manifest file.

```ts
new WebpackAssetsManifest({
  integrity: true,
  integrityHashes: ["sha384"],
  writeToDisk: true,
  entrypoints: false,
  entrypointsUseAssets: true,
  publicPath,
  // Ignore a source maps and compressed files.
  customize(e) {
    if (e.key.endsWith(".map") || e.key.endsWith(".gz")) {
      return false;
    }

    return e;
  },
})
```

Specifying `writeToDisk: true` allows running the `webpack-dev-server` as proxy to the Rails application, and still generate correct assets links in Rails code. `rails-assets-manifest` defaults to using `public/assets/assets-manifest.json` as the manifest path.

## TODO

* Override/Join with `asset_host` URL?
